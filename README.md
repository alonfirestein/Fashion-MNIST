# Fashion-MNIST

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset consisting of a training set of 60,000 images and a testing set of 10,000 images. Each image is 28x28 grayscale, associated with a label from 10 different features.
Using different Machine Learning Algorithims (Supervised, Unsupervised and Deep Learning), I will try to get the models to predict what type of clothing/label is in each 28x28 grayscale image with the highest accuracy I can achieve.

### Fashion MNIST Classification using different ML models and Dimension reduction using PCA.

For an easy comparison of the results of all the models, go to the bottom of the notebook.
